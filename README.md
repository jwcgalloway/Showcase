This repository contains programming works written by James Galloway as part of the completion of his 
Computer Science degree at the Queensland University of Technology.  

Each project contained in this repository is described below.

## ArmBeta
ArmBeta is an Android application that is used in tandem with a Microsoft Band.  The application is able to read, interpret and
present useful information about the user's arm movements.  The end goal for this project is to assist in the rehabilitation of 
hemiparetic victims of stroke. This is an ongoing project being written as part of James' final year project.

All code was written in the Java programming language.

## DNA & Homology
This project is an simplified computer simulation of the evolutionary process.  It takes as input a text file (contained in the 'tests' folder)
that contains a trace/log of a sequence of evolutionary events that are to be modelled. Each line of the file contains a separate evolutionary 
event and these events are applied in order from first/top line to last/bottom line. Each species is identified by an integer id, with the first 
species given a species id of 1. Each species has a distinct genome - the genetic material or DNA associated with the organism. The application 
tracks the genome for each species as evolution proceeds.

The application also tracks where each segment of that gene originated from. Two genes are referred to as Homologous if at least part of 
those genes evolved from a common section of DNA.

All code was written in the F# programming language in a pure functional fashion.

## Genetic Algorithm
This project mimics the classic mouse maze experiment wherein a mouse is tasked with locating a piece of cheese in a maze. It then employs a genetic
algorithm to find a solution to the maze and improve on it.  The essence of the problem is finding a route from the starting point to 
this piece of cheese. Hence, a solution to this problem would be any path that runs from the starting point to the cheese.  Solutions that
are more efficient, that is, take less steps to reach the cheese, are preferred.

All code was written in the F# programming language with a liberal approach to mutability. 

## Media Vault
Media Vault is a cloud-based personal media library. It allows you to store any format of media (audio, video, photos, ebooks) and to 
organise this media in a personally meaningful manner. You are able to browse or search for media that you want and select to either 
access it for immediate use or download it to a device to be used later.  The project is currently offline, and no web address can be
provided.  However, all code used has been included.

This project was written using HTML, PHP, Javascript, jQuery, CSS, and MySQL.
